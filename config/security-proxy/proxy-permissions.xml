<!-- This file handles security settings for the internal proxy that we use
     to workaround browser's same-origin policy.
     The proxy can be reached at the /proxy/?url= endpoint.
     These settings are important to prevent exploration of internal services
     from the outside world !

     Here are the settings:

     allowByDefault: if set to true, the 'allowed' list of rules will be checked
                     before the 'denied' list.
                       * If an URL simultaneously matches an urimatcher from the
                     allowed list and an urimatcher from the denied list, then
                     this URL will be allowed.
                       * If an URL does not match any urimatcher, then it
                     will be allowed.

                     If set to false, rules from the 'denied' list will be
                     examined before the rules from the 'allowed' list.
                     If no rule matches the requested URL, access will be denied.

     denied: list of 'urimatcher' rules (evaluated with a logical *OR*).
             If one 'urimatcher' matches the requested URL, proxying is denied.

     allowed: list of 'urimatcher' rules (evaluated with a logical *OR*).
             If one 'urimatcher' matches the requested URL, proxying is allowed.

     urimatcher: list of conditions evaluated with a *AND* logical operator.

     host: this rule will match all IP addresses of the specified host. This means
           that the IP address of the requested URL will be compared to all IP
           addresses of the specified host.

     domain: case insensitive regexp to match the domain part of the requested URL.

     port: matches port of the requested URL.

     path: case insensitive regexp to match the 'path' part of the requested URL.

     network: IP address with a network mask to specify a range of IP addresses. 
            Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported.


     Example making use of all tags:
     <permissions>
         <allowByDefault>true</allowByDefault>
         <allowed>
             <urimatcher>
                 <domain>.*\.georchestra\.org</domain>
             </urimatcher>
         </allowed>
         <denied>
             <urimatcher>
                 <host>localhost</host>
             </urimatcher>
             <urimatcher>
                 <domain>sdi.example.org</domain>
                 <port>443</port>
                 <path>/geonetwork/</path>
             </urimatcher>
             <urimatcher>
                 <network>10.42.0.0/16</network>
             </urimatcher>
         </denied>
     </permissions>

     The first urimatcher allows proxing of requests to all georchestra.org
     subdomains.

     The second urimatcher denies access to all IP addresses for the local host.

     The third urimatcher denies access to https://sdi.example.org/geonetwork/*

     The last urimatcher denies access to all IPv4 addresses which start with 10.42
